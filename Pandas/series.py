import pandas as pd

# A Pandas series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold many data types, such as numbers or strings. One of the main differences between Pandas Series and NumPy ndarrays is that you can assign an index label to each element in the Pandas Series. In other words, you can name the indices of your Pandas Series anything you want. Another big difference between Pandas Series and NumPy ndarrays is that Pandas Series can hold data of different data types.

# We import Pandas as pd into Python
import pandas as pd

# We create a Pandas Series that stores a grocery list
groceries = pd.Series(data = [30, 6, 'Yes', 'No'], index = ['eggs', 'apples', 'milk', 'bread'])

# We display the Groceries Pandas Series
groceries


# We print some information about Groceries
print('Groceries has shape:', groceries.shape)
print('Groceries has dimension:', groceries.ndim)
print('Groceries has a total of', groceries.size, 'elements')

# We print the index and data of Groceries
print('The data in Groceries is:', groceries.values)
print('The index of Groceries is:', groceries.index)

# We check whether bananas is a food item (an index) in Groceries
x = 'bananas' in groceries

# We check whether bread is a food item (an index) in Groceries
y = 'bread' in groceries

# We print the results
print('Is bananas an index label in Groceries:', x)
print('Is bread an index label in Groceries:', y)

# We access elements in Groceries using index labels:

# We use a single index label
print('How many eggs do we need to buy:', groceries['eggs'])
print()

# we can access multiple index labels
print('Do we need milk and bread:\n', groceries[['milk', 'bread']])
print()

# we use loc to access multiple index labels
print('How many eggs and apples do we need to buy:\n', groceries.loc[['eggs', 'apples']])
print()

# We access elements in Groceries using numerical indices:

# we use multiple numerical indices
print('How many eggs and apples do we need to buy:\n',  groceries[[0, 1]])
print()

# We use a negative numerical index
print('Do we need bread:\n', groceries[[-1]])
print()

# We use a single numerical index
print('How many eggs do we need to buy:', groceries[0])
print()
# we use iloc to access multiple numerical indices
print('Do we need milk and bread:\n', groceries.iloc[[2, 3]])


# We display the original grocery list
print('Original Grocery List:\n', groceries)

# We change the number of eggs to 2
groceries['eggs'] = 2

# We display the changed grocery list
print()
print('Modified Grocery List:\n', groceries)



# We can also delete items from a Pandas Series by using the .drop() method. The Series.drop(label) method removes the given label from the given Series. We should note that the Series.drop(label) method drops elements from the Series out of place, meaning that it doesn't change the original Series being modified. Let's see how this works:

# We display the original grocery list
print('Original Grocery List:\n', groceries)

# We remove apples from our grocery list. The drop function removes elements out of place
print()
print('We remove apples (out of place):\n', groceries.drop('apples'))

# When we remove elements out of place the original Series remains intact. To see this
# we display our grocery list again
print()
print('Grocery List after removing apples out of place:\n', groceries)




#ARithmetic operations



# We create a Pandas Series that stores a grocery list of just fruits
fruits= pd.Series(data = [10, 6, 3,], index = ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas'])

# We display the fruits Pandas Series
fruits

# We print fruits for reference
print('Original grocery list of fruits:\n ', fruits)

# We perform basic element-wise operations using arithmetic symbols
print()
print('fruits + 2:\n', fruits + 2) # We add 2 to each item in fruits
print()
print('fruits - 2:\n', fruits - 2) # We subtract 2 to each item in fruits
print()
print('fruits * 2:\n', fruits * 2) # We multiply each item in fruits by 2
print()
print('fruits / 2:\n', fruits / 2) # We divide each item in fruits by 2
print()


# We import NumPy as np to be able to use the mathematical functions
import numpy as np

# We print fruits for reference
print('Original grocery list of fruits:\n', fruits)

# We apply different mathematical functions to all elements of fruits
print()
print('EXP(X) = \n', np.exp(fruits))
print()
print('SQRT(X) =\n', np.sqrt(fruits))
print()
print('POW(X,2) =\n',np.power(fruits,2)) # We raise all elements of fruits to the power of 2


# Pandas also allows us to only apply arithmetic operations on selected items in our fruits grocery list. Let's see some examples
# We print fruits for reference
print('Original grocery list of fruits:\n ', fruits)
print()

# We add 2 only to the bananas
print('Amount of bananas + 2 = ', fruits['bananas'] + 2)
print()

# We subtract 2 from apples
print('Amount of apples - 2 = ', fruits.iloc[0] - 2)
print()

# We multiply apples and oranges by 2
print('We double the amount of apples and oranges:\n', fruits[['apples', 'oranges']] * 2)
print()

# We divide apples and oranges by 2
print('We half the amount of apples and oranges:\n', fruits.loc[['apples', 'oranges']] / 2)

# You can also apply arithmetic operations on Pandas Series of mixed data type provided that the arithmetic operation is defined for all data types in the Series, otherwise you will get an error. Let's see what happens when we multiply our grocery list by 2

# We multiply our grocery list by 2
groceries * 2
